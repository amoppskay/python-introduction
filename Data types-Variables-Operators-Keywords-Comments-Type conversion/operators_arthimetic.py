# Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, remainder etc
# like bank acct operations or calculations and you dont want to do then manually, you need arithmetic ops then

# Examples of Arithmetic Operator
a = 9
b = 4

# Addition of numbers
add = a + b

# Subtraction of numbers
sub = a - b

# Multiplication of number
mul = a * b

# Division(float) of number
div1 = a / b

# Division(floor) of number
div2 = a // b
# when division is done and you dont need the decimal use // so it will take .25 out

# Module of both number
mod = a % b
# mod operation divides the number and gives the remainder 9/4 = 8 remainder 1

# Power
p = a ** b
# this raises it power, here it is 9 raised to the power of 4, here you use **

# print results
print(add)
print(sub)
print(mul)
print(div1)
print(div2)
print(mod)
print(p)
