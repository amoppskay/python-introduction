# Logical operators perform Logical AND, Logical OR, and Logical NOT operations. It is used to combine conditional statements.

# Examples of Logical Operator
# a = True
# b = False

# Print a and b is False
# print(a and b)
# when "and" is used, everything has to be true, all the values must be same to return true

maths = True
science = False

# Print maths and science is False
print(maths and science)

# print maths or science is True
print(maths or science)
# "or" is used when one either of them is true or false, it will return true

# Print not maths is False
print(not maths)
# "not" is the reverse operation, when one is true, it will return false, when it's false it will return true

# # Print a or b is True
# print(a or b)

# # Print not a is False
# print(not a)
