# examples for int data type
# print(10+20)
# print(100)

# quantity = 10
# price = 3

# item_quantity = 1018935
# item_price = 303456
# print(item_quantity*item_price)

# print(type(1))
# type(100)
# # no fxn value on lne 13 because you didnt ask it to print

# examples for string data type which must be in ("")
# print("Titi")
# # student = "Titi"
# student = "Adetoun"

# print(student)
# print(type(student))

# print(student, " in now in JJTech")
# student is used a variable, hence it isnt in "" so student becomes a key and will return the vlaue of whatever 
# name we put as student

# print(True) 
# print(False)
# print(type(True))
# print(type(False))

# is_paid = False
# print("Doors open", is_paid)

# is_paid = True
# print("Doors open", is_paid)

blood_group = None
# dont add  "" so it doesnt look like string, python picks it as None data type
print(blood_group)

print(type(None))
# this will print type as <class 'NoneType'>
